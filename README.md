# Chaotic Signal Processing (CSP) 

Chaotic Signal Processing (CSP) is a workshop concerned with digital audio signal processing (DSP) within generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition.

This workshop also aims to illustrate and discuss why it is productive to engage in the *text-based* programming of sounds and compositions in contrast to using high-level interfaces like digital audio workstations (DAWs) ( e.g Ableton Live, FL Studio ) and patch-based applications ( e.g PureData, Max ).

on a pragmatic level this workshop will start with a brief introduction to the building blocks of DSP ( e.g samples, oscillators, filters, effects, envelopes, synthesis ), then exposes the participants to some basal strategies for combining DSP and compositional strategies, and will end on experiments with those concepts as well as their integration into existing audio ecosystems ( e.g DAWs, MIDI devices ).

the workshop will mainly use [Wellen](https://github.com/dennisppaul/wellen) a java-based Processing.org library but will also have a brief glance at other languages or platforms.

a few prerequisite need to be met: 

- laptop with audio in-+output
- basic/good understanding of programming languages like java/processing, javascript and/or C/C++
- full commitment to the session to the extent that it's absurd
- resilience to chaotic sounds and noises
- opt. BYOHP ( Bring Your Own Headphones ) 
- opt. BTOMCU ( Bring Your Own MicroController Unit e.g teensy+audio_shield )
- opt. BYOHW ( Bring Your Own HardWare e.g MIDI devices, external sound cards, guitars )
